# Introductory Arduino Assignment Log

* Today we worked on trying to switch around our board. 
* We thought that our board was a reflection of all the other ones and were trying to work in reflection to the prototype. This wouldn't make sense though because we know that the board works by connecting horizontal lines. We are still working with this puzzle
* We got the light blinking on our board and got the LED working on Leon's board. We went and retreived Ms. Kirby's LED code and are now going to try and switch around aspects so that the button goes on when the light is pressed and the light stays off when the button is untouched. 
* Our biggest challenge is still trying to work with our board. We have tried resetting our board like the prototype, reversed from the prototype, set like leon;s board and also set like Greg's example board.
* Next week we want to be able to work on our board and be less dependant on other peoples boards before we continue with coding.
* Kahyaps and Ali merged into the group

* We figured out our LED positive and negative were flipped by checking our buttons on another groups board and realizing that the positives and negatives do play a part
* We realized the placements of the wires on either side of the button played a part in its functionality. We had one large wire traveling from 27 to 24 both on the ground side. We then changed to 27 on ground side to 22 on the opposite side if the button. Now out button WORKS!
